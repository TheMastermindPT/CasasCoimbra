I demonstrated my broad web development skills through the creation of a comprehensive website. This project included the design of an engaging landing page and a streamlined back office for managing client information. 

JavaScript was key in adding dynamic features to the website, boosting user interactivity and creating engaging elements. CSS and SASS were employed to create a visually appealing interface that combined function with style.

Node.js was used to enhance server-side data handling, optimizing user interactions and data processing. The addition of jQuery allowed for dynamic and responsive website elements, contributing to a smooth user experience and interactive content. 

PHP was utilized for robust server-side logic, ensuring efficient and reliable back-end operations and data handling. SQL was used for effective database management, enabling smooth data retrieval and storage and maintaining data integrity.

WebPack was a valuable asset in boosting the website's performance, allowing for effective bundling and optimization of web assets. This resulted in a visually stunning, responsive, and fast website. 

The website was designed with a focus on responsive design, ensuring an excellent user experience on any device by adapting to different screen sizes seamlessly. A dynamic property showcase was a key feature, using Google Maps Integration via JavaScript and the Google Maps API to provide users with a clear view of property locations. 

Detailed room photos were integrated into the showcase with JavaScript, enhancing the presentation and offering users a captivating visual experience. Facebook and WhatsApp support channels were integrated to facilitate customer support, with JavaScript and jQuery enabling real-time assistance and community engagement for direct communication between users and the client's team.

SASS was crucial in creating a visually pleasing and functionally robust design, contributing to visually stunning and responsive web pages, and ensuring an engaging user interface.
